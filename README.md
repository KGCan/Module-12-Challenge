## Concept
As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company so that I can organize and plan my business.

## Goals
- Given a note-taking application
- When I open the Note Taker
- Then I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page
When I click on the link to the notes page
- Then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
- When I enter a new note title and the note’s text
- Then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
- When I click on the Save icon
- Then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
- When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
- Then that note appears in the right-hand column
- When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
- Then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
